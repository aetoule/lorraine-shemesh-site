            <p>Lorraine Shemesh's work will always be, in part, defined by her paintings of the body in water moving in refracted light. They are unique in contemporary painting and they comprise, over the years, a series that evolves from the early 1990s through 2015. In these paintings she explores human anatomy, color, light, and the materiality of paint in ways that are sensuously compelling and conceptually rich. She probes the relationship between abstraction and form, and the dazzling complexity of her color and brush strokes evoke elements of Jackson Pollock's action painting, the color field of Helen Frankenthaler, and the tonal planes of Milton Avery. There are always layers of her fine draughtsmanship in her paintings, and whether she is making big brush strokes of swimmers or dancers or drawing bodies in muscular contortions, her hand continues a tradition of drawing that includes Pollaiuolo, Goya, Van Gogh, and Matisse.</p>
            <p>In her exploration of water on light, the play of refraction on color---the turquoise of the water on the textiles (bathing suits) of the moving bodyâ€”she creates surfaces that open to deep seeing, just as water is surface opening to underwater. She's a realist who brings solidity of form to the brink of abstraction as she creates lightâ€”scintillating and accreting-- modeling the body through the refraction of water, in what strikes me as furthering mode of luminist expression.</p>
